# ESP16_Connector
Simple connector for the ESP-16 pressure transducer. The custom connector (12-pin) continually broke accidentally because its pins are exposed and very fragile. This is a fix for it. I'm assuming the Miniature DB-15 side of the cable is intact (usually true because that side is well-protected by a shell.)

BOM to fix this connector is very simple:
Just get 3x 4-pin header connectors with 0.018" (0.45mm) diameter pins. Here's the connector I used:

Solder the headers according to the connection diagram inside the Pictures folder.
